SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE-CYCLE (SDLC)

Understanding and applying DevOps in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) has become a crucial part of modern software engineering.
DevOps is not just a set of tools but a cultural and professional movement that encourages closer collaboration between developers and operations teams, 
reducing the silos that traditionally slowed down the software development process.

In the SDLC, DevOps plays a critical role from the initial stages of development through to deployment and maintenance. By integrating DevOps practices, 
organizations can achieve continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), ensuring that new features and updates are tested, integrated, and deployed 
faster without sacrificing quality. This not only improves the speed to market but also enhances the reliability of software releases.

Additionally, DevOps helps teams identify issues early in the development cycle through automated testing and monitoring, which leads to fewer bugs in production. This approach reduces the cost of fixing issues later in the process, allowing teams to be more agile and responsive to customer needs. Learning DevOps is essential for developers who want to remain competitive in the industry, as it fosters a mindset of continuous improvement and efficient workflow management.
