Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

The software development life cycle is the cost and time-efficient process that is used by development 
teams to design and build high-level software. The SDLC is a circular system put in place in the 
beginning stages of software development and is kept in play until the software is no longer supported.
SDLC begins by analyzing the project's requirements. Once the requirement has been recognized, 
the planning stage begins. After the team has completed planning, the software architecture is designed
to give the software development stage a guide to follow. After development, rigorous testing is 
completed to ensure the software is deployment-ready. Once deployed, the team will reconviene to 
re-analyze the requirements and begin the process of maintaining the software.
