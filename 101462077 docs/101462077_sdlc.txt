Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

The software development life cycle is the cost and time-efficient process that is used by development 
teams to design and build high-level software. The SDLC is a circular system put in place in the 
beginning stages of software development and is kept in play until the software is no longer supported.
SDLC begins by analyzing the project's requirements. Once the requirement has been recognized, 
the planning stage begins. After the team has completed planning, the software architecture is designed
to give the software development stage a guide to follow. After development, rigorous testing is 
completed to ensure the software is deployment-ready. Once deployed, the team will reconvene to 
re-analyze the requirements and begin the process of maintaining the software.

SDLC is an integral part of DevOps, as it brings together development and planning teams working on the
same project. The SDLC is the map and timeline created that prevents miscommunicating objectives and 
provides a clear understanding of what each team member is to complete. The DevOps engineer's job is to 
manage the CI/CD pipeline and automate the deployed steps. The SDLC provided the developers with the 
knowledge of how to interact with the DevOps engineer to ensure maximum time efficiency.
